# Jumpscare Mod (A Celeste Mod)

Add some spice to your Celeste gameplay! This mod will randomly jumpscare you whenever you die, so beware.

## Jumpscare Settings

Photosensitive mode disables the image flashes.
The "Jumpscare Odds" numbers indicate a 1 in n chance of triggering the jumpscare, meaning the bigger the number, the less likely it is for you to get a jumpscare.

## Editing the jumpscare assets

To edit the jumpscare image, replace the image in Graphics/Atlases/Gameplay/dumb/jumpscare.png. 
To edit the audio, you'll have to make an FMOD bank "Jumpscare", import your audio as "jumpscareAudio" in the folder "CodeNat" (complicated stuff, try following the EverestAPI guide for it).
